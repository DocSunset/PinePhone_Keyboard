Configs and settings for the PinePhone Keyboard

### Background Information

Since kernel > 5.17, the top row keymapping for the following symbols doesn't work (keys for |\£€~`-=_+). To address this I have made a list of changes below of your use cases, either TTY or GUI. 

### TTY Only Settings

Check out the directory PinePhone_Keyboard/tty for more information and config files.

### GUI Only Settings

Check out the directory PinePhone_Keyboard/xkb for more information and config files.
